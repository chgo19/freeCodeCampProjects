            <h3 class="">Here is a timeline of Nikola Tesla's Life:</h3><br/>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His parents were ethnic Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his inventiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</li>
                <li><strong>1882</strong> - He went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
                <li><strong>1882</strong> - Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li>
                <li><strong>1884</strong> - Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li>
                <li><strong>1885</strong> - After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li>
                <li><strong>1886</strong> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>
                <li><strong>1887</strong> - The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
                <li><strong>1901</strong> - construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>
                <li><strong>1915</strong> - On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>
                <li><strong>1960</strong> - the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.</li>
